		<h1> About Me - </h1>
		<p style="text-indent:5%;"> Hello! My name is Quinn Knapper and I am currently enrolled as a student at the
			Georgia Institute of Technology in the college of Civil Engineering. I hope to pursue a career in
			city planning, urban develelopment, or contracting, but I am still learning and I love to exercise
			my growing knowledge.
	
		<p style="text-indent:5%;"> I enjoy playing video games (mostly <i>Super Smash Bros</i>), disc golf & ultimate,
			running, and pretty much anything else fun. I currently host an hour of the "Rock Rythym and Roll" show from 2-3pm EST on
			91.1fm WREK Atlanta, doing my part to bring the some of best tunes around to the greater
			Atlanta area. I enjoy watching TV shows and movies (except scary ones) with my current favorites being
			<i>Megamind</i> and the animated series <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>. </p>
		<p style="text-indent:5%;"> That's all for me, but if you have questions or anything to say feel free to visit the <a href="contact.html">
			Contact Me</a> page for more information. </p> <br> 
		<p>- <b> Quinn Knapper </b>: author, creator, design, and everything else. -</p>
		<p> P.S. &ensp; That teddy bear over on the left is my best friend QuinnBear, and I love him very much. </p> <br>
