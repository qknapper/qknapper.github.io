				This is my website, I'm sure you'll find something you can enjoy. Content is pretty sparce for now, but I'm working on it. If there is anything awesome you'd like to see, I am open to suggestions! You should be able to find some of the following here soon:
			</p>
				<p class="listEntry">- A catalog of my playing card collection</p>
				<p class="listEntry">- Disc golf courses I've played and my scores</p>
				<p class="listEntry">- Instagram is stupid and locked me out, so maybe updates on stuff I do</p>
				<p class="listEntry">- Other activities and summaries (maybe running or basketball)</p>
				<p class="listEntry">- Maybe a visitor's log for saying hi to people!</p>
